# Advent of Code 2019
This is a personal repository of solutions for [Advent of Code 2019](http://adventofcode.com/2019). Language may differ from solution to solution but is most likely either PowerShell, Python or Node.js

Some puzzles are likely skipped or not yet started. A few are probably broken or unfinished. And most are usually inefficient. Some comments or progress status may be kept in `notes.txt`
